nodejs API to apache lucene Java implementation. 

# Features

 * Node.js API straightforward translated / ported from Java API (trying to respect the original Java packages, types and interfaces as far as I could)
 * lucene Java Api calls binding directly called from node.js thanks to node-java. (no IPC, no process spawn, no server)
 * lucene java easily upgradable and included along the project
 * Requirements: Node.js and java

# Usage
```sh
npm install --save node-lucene
```


```ts
const lucene = require('node-lucene')
// or `import * as lucene from 'node-lucene'`

// We will be indexing the following "books":
const books = [
  {
    content: 'The most merciful thing in the world, I think, is the inability of the human mind to correlate all its contents.',
    title: 'One Hundred Years of Solitude',
    author: 'Gabriel Garcia Marquez'
  },
  {
    content: 'It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.',
    title: '1984',
    author: 'George Orwell'
  },
  {
    content: 'Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.',
    author: 'Leo Tolstoy',
    title: 'Anna Karenina'
  },
  {
    content: 'True! – nervous – very, very nervous I had been and am; but why will you say that I am mad?',
    author: 'Edgar Allan Poe',
    title: 'The Tell-Tale Heart'
  }
]

// before using this library make sure you call the following function for loading lucene .jars in Java classpath:
lucene.initialize()

// create lucene index in memory:
const analyzer = new lucene.analysis.standard.StandardAnalyzer()
const writerConfig = new lucene.index.IndexWriterConfig(analyzer)
const index = new lucene.store.RAMDirectory()
const writer = new lucene.index.IndexWriter(index, writerConfig)

// add the documents:
books.forEach(book => {
  const doc = new lucene.document.Document()
  doc.add(new lucene.document.TextField('content', book.content, lucene.document.FieldStore.YES))
  doc.add(new lucene.document.TextField('author', book.author, lucene.document.FieldStore.YES))
  doc.add(new lucene.document.TextField('title', book.title, lucene.document.FieldStore.YES))
  writer.addDocument(doc)
})

// because we finished adding documents we close the index so we can start searching:
writer.close()

// now we want to search so we create a directory reader, index searcher and a query parser
const directory = lucene.index.DirectoryReader.open(index)
const searcher = new lucene.search.IndexSearcher(directory)
const parser = new lucene.queryparser.classic.QueryParser('content', analyzer)

// searching for 'phrase does not exists' should return 0 results
let topDocs = searcher.search(parser.parse('phrase does not exists'), 10)

// searching for 'cold' should return 1 results. We iterate found documents and print its author and titles:
topDocs = searcher.search(parser.parse('cold'), 10) //TODO: lucene issue : why searching for 'the' is returning 0 results ? 

// now get back the document from the index to access matched book's author and title
const foundDoc = searcher.doc(topDocs.scoreDocs[0].doc)
console.log(`Found "${foundDoc.get('title')}" authored by ${foundDoc.get('author')}`);

```

# Status 

**WIP / Planning**

 * still deciding if handcrafting an implementation or autogenerating it using java2js like tool. Right now just a handcrafted respecting original lucene java package structure with folders and TS namespaces and using autogenerated java2js interfaces as reference / copy/paste 

# why?

 * lucene is THE best index / search engine implementation
 * I want to call lucene API directly from my nodejs program without fork(), spawn(), request(), socket, or any IPC. 
 * I want to use original lucene java implementation not a clone/port like lucy and easily upgrade the java lucene implementation at any time. 
 * I want to call lucene java from node.js using analog API as fast a s possible. 
 * I don't want to start a server like solr or elasticsearch. Example: a text editor indexing lots of source code as eclipse IDE does.

# TODO
 * make all extends java.lang.object and this should extends JavaBase - so they all implement toString() etc
 * contribute node-java README: to document standard `promisify: require('util').promisify` so no library is necessary. Also implement it as default promisify impl if exists since its supported from node 8.0.0 (LTS version now so it should be available in most cases) .
 * use https://github.com/joeferner/node-java-maven to manage lucene jars and run in npm prepare script
 * do reflection in java to get method / class signatures and generate TS interfaces and implementations automatically using java2js. We realized this will be very hard task but would be ideal.
 * contribute node-java README: fix several typos : "classes seperate usi" several typos : "if an error occures", "sted classes seperate u"
 * consider deprecating *Async methods since promises are available OOTB in node LTS, can be pollyfilled in older Node versions and callbacks are "obsolete" today in favor of promises. Supporting *Async is double work and testing it is harder (testing promises is just copy&paste *Sync and add async/await while testing *Async implies callbacks and require('async') - test code is totally different - too much work and no real gain). 
 * async constructors ? today calling `var o = new java.lang.Object()` is sync - should we support async analogy for example, `var o = await java.lang.Object.newAsync()`
 * node-java - README - getStaticFieldValue  parameter  "callback(err, item) - Callback to be called when the class is created."   is confusing - is it really exists ? and if then " class is created" is wrong
