generate javascript implementations of given Java classes of .jars / .class files based on node-java and optionally typescript interfaces / classes

very WIP - Research


# Initial research Notes

## output project structure  different alternatives

 * alternative one: flat folder with all classes names fixed inside 
 * folder tree org.apache.lucene.store.RAMDirectory generates org/apache/lucene/store/RAMDirectory.ts

initially default impl is the later



# TODO

 * references to other types like "returns": "org.foo.Bar" - need to add imports and exports . 
 * references to other types: What happens reference is external ? should we create it or warn the user - configurable ?
 * java natives (java.lang.String) translated to js natives
 * user able to configure format of arguments names (autogenerated)
 * support overrides in ts interfaces
 * other output project structures like flat one ? - low prio
