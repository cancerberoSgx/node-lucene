generate javascript implementations of given Java classes of .jars / .class files based on node-java and optionally typescript interfaces / classes

Generates a TypeScript project 
very WIP - Research


# The following are Initial research Notes

# how is the API

the call will be something like this the important part is the config object
```ts
javaToJs({
})

```
## API Alternative 1

```ts
interface Java2JsConfig extends JavapConfig {
}
```

# Output type for content

 * Should we generate .ts files contents strings or estree AST (https://github.com/estree/formal/tree/master/formal-data/typescript) ? for now we generate content as strings since with that we can parse it to estree AST

## output project structure  different alternatives

 * alternative one: flat folder with all classes names fixed inside 
 * folder tree org.apache.lucene.store.RAMDirectory generates org/apache/lucene/store/RAMDirectory.ts

initially default impl is the later



# TODO
 * decide the API
 * User able to configure output type "only interfaces", "only interfaces one file", "interfaces and node-java implementations"
 * references to other types like "returns": "org.foo.Bar" - need to add imports and exports . 
 generate signatures for node-java sync & async methods which is configurable and we should expose and respect : https://github.com/joeferner/node-java#asyncoptions-control-over-the-generation-of-sync-async--promise-method-variants 
 * references to other types: What happens reference is external ? should we create it or warn the user - configurable ?
 * java natives (java.lang.String) translated to js natives
 * user able to configure format of arguments names (autogenerated)
 * support overrides in ts interfaces
 * other output project structures like flat one ? - low prio
