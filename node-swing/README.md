nodejs API to Java Swing

 - right now just an experiment to see if we can bring java swing API to TypeScript just as we did for lucene

# Features

 * Node.js API straightforward translated / ported from Java API (trying to respect the original Java packages, types and interfaces as far as I could)
 * Java Api calls binding directly called from node.js thanks to node-java. (no IPC, no process spawn, no server)
  * Requirements: Node.js and java

# Usage

```sh
npm install --save node-swing
```

## Example: indexing and searching in RAM 

```ts
// TODO
```
